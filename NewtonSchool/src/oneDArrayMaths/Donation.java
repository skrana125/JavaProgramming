/*
After the decimation, all world went into chaos. People had to rebuild the planet so Shield came up with a donation strategy.
They feel all the rich guys need to donate more than the poor guys. So, they make a rule.
They would make a donation list in which the donation of each person would be shown.
But the rule is that a person canâ€™t pay less than what has already been paid before them.
Find the extra amount each person will pay, and also, tell shield the total amount of donation.

Constraints:-
1 <= n <= 100000
0 <= money <= 100000

Sample Input:-
10
1 2 3 2 4 3 6 6 7 6

Sample Output:-
0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
43

Sample Input:-

10 20 30 40 30 20 10

Sample Output:-
